# Library_Project


I developed a website for the library, with a menu that allowed users (students, teachers and staff) to log in, register and recover their password. When selecting registration, users entered information such as name, student number, year of enrollment, telephone number, email and password. After registering, they were directed to the login page, where they could access the book list and use the search bar to find specific titles.
